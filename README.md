#CODER SWAG

##Lesson 01 / github branch 01
followed mark explicitly. code complete and story board setup exactly the same. Run time model looks the same. Hopefully we figure out what the difference between coder-swag and this example is.

##Lesson 02 / github branch 02
followed along explixitly. Code is giving problems with .getCategoryies function doesn't like the .count or .[index.path] however I'm exshausted and having trouble keeping eyes open. have will post on discord

##Lesson 02-2 working out what I did wrong with getCategory()
I followed exactly but went wrong someplace so I'm going back through the lesson and figure out what I did wrong. Named Lesson-03 branch from github.

everything is fixed :D moved on to next lesson, somehow I missed some stuff as I was really tired, parsed through the lesson, fixed it found next problem, that was a problem with coder-swag, fixed the bug and now going really well.

##Lesson 04 branch after fixing the previous issues we are now up-to-date

wow, big lesson, app finished, still getting it slowly. able to see how each compartment works for itself and passes required information to another. Still lots to learn.
